# Introduction to Programming in C - Winter 2023

This is a repository documenting my journey through the Introduction to Programming in C course at Seneca College in Winter 2023. 
This course was my gateway into the vast world of programming, where I learned the foundational concepts of the C programming language, a cornerstone in software development.

## Course Overview

This course covered essential programming fundamentals, focusing on:
- Variables and Data Types: Mastering C's basic building blocks.
- Control Structures: Implementing logic flow with conditionals and loops.
- Functions and Modular Programming: Developing reusable code pieces for better program structure.
- Memory Management: Understanding dynamic memory allocation and pointers.

## Skills Developed

- **Problem-Solving**: Tackling programming challenges with efficient solutions.
- **Critical Thinking**: Applying logic and structured thinking to develop clean, maintainable code.
- **Technical Proficiency**: Gaining a deep understanding of the C programming language and its application in software development.

## Assignments and Final Project

Here, you'll find a collection of my assignments and final project that demonstrate my learning progress and application of the above concepts. 
Through these assignments and the final project, I not only learned how to code in C but also how to think like a programmer, approaching problems with a logical, structured methodology. 
This repository is a testament to my hard work, dedication, and passion for programming.

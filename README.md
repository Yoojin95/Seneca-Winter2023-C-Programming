# Seneca Winter2023 IPC144 course 

This repository is about my journey through the "Introduction to Programming in C" course at Seneca College in Winter 2023. 
This course served as my gateway into the world of programming, laying the foundational stones for understanding and utilizing the C programming language, 
which is one of the most powerful and widely used languages in the world of software development. This journey not only equipped me with technical skills 
but also taught me to apply theoretical concepts in practical scenarios, preparing me for advanced topics in computer science and future software development projects.

# Variables and Data Types
I gained a thorough understanding of C's data types, crucial for handling various data operations and ensuring efficient memory usage.

# Control Structures
I learned to use conditional logic and loops (if-else statements, for, while, and do-while loops) to control program flow, enabling decision-making and repetitive task automation.

# Functions and Modular Programming
I developed the ability to design and implement functions, enhancing code reusability, readability, and maintenance. 
Modular programming practices helped me break down complex problems into manageable pieces.

# Memory Management
I delved into dynamic memory allocation and pointers, learning to manage memory directly, which is essential for writing efficient and adaptable programs.
